# NYC-MTA
The NYC subway system continues to serve as the most important mode of transport for the people living or working in NYC for their daily commute and running errands. Hence, we believe that it is important to understand the ridership behaviour to strategize infrastructure improvements, plan business activities in and around the metro stations and other steps that are required to enhance the commuters experience.
Also, we would like to predict the number of Entries to a station as NYC subway stations are one of the busiest public transit so that this analysis can be used to figure out which station would be the busiest and can be used by any public departments like for example Police patrolling on the stations with highest entries in case of any public emergencies.
